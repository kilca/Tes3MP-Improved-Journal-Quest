Journal@a2_4_milogone@From the Apographa, Gilvas Barelo gave me a document called 'Kagrenac's Tools'. This document describes the terrible secret that the Temple conceals about the true history of the Tribunal and the corrupt nature of their divine powers.

Journal@a2_4_milogone@The Heirographa are the collected priestly writings of the Temple. The Apographa are the 'hidden writings' -- secrets known only at the highest levels of priesthood and inquisition. The Dissident priests have gathered much of the Apographa in Holamayan.

Journal@a2_4_milogone@The appearance of the Sixth House is clearly a sign of a coming crisis, according to Gilvas Barelo. In such troubled times, the Dunmer may turn to the ancient pillars of faith, the ancestors and the Daedra, and the prophetic visions granted by Lord Azura.
